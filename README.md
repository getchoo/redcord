# redcord-rust
A rewrite of my redcord app (found [here](https://github.com/sethfl/redcord)) in pure Rust. It is currently in development, and thus nonfunctional. It is simply here to provide a backup for the project, as well as to allow for contributions. Any help would be appreciated. 

## Progress Plan:
The short-term goal of this project is to be able to send a random image from a user determined subreddit, into a discord chat. The long term goal is to increase this functionality by increasing the support for the reddit API, allowing for features such as links to text posts, comments, viewing flairs, upvote counts, and more, all in discord! 

To see the current progress on development, take a look at the [project page](https://github.com/sethfl/redcord-rust/projects/1).
